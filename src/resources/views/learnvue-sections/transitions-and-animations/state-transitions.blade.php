    <h2><a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitioning-state.html">State Transitions</a></h2>

    <p>Vue's transition system offers many simple ways to animate entering, leaving and lists. Other transitions that have not been covered could be:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>numbers and calculations</li>
        <li>colors displayed</li>
        <li>positions of SVG nodes</li>
        <li>sizes and other properties of elements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitioning-state.html#Animating-State-with-Watchers">Animating State with Watchers</a></h3>

    <p>Watchers are used to animate changes of any numerical property into another property. The example below uses Tween.js to animate a number change.</p>

    <div id="vue-animated-state-with-watcher">
        <animated-state-with-watcher class="vue-component-root row" />
    </div>

    <p>For non-numeric values (such as any valid CSS color) this could be accomplished by including Color.js</p>

    <p>TODO: Example on Vue.js doesn't work, come back to later</p>

    <h3><a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitioning-state.html#Dynamic-State-Transitions">Dynamic State Transitions</a></h3>

    <p>As with Vue's transition components, the data backing state transitions can be updated in real time, which is especially useful for prototyping.</p>

    <p>TODO: More examples/samples</p>
